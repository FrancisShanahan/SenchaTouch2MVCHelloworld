Simple Sencha Touch 2.0 MVC application scaffold. 

This is a simple application which lays out the Model, View, Controller and Stores within a Sencha Touch 2.0 application. I looked long and hard but found no examples. This one was based loosely on the ExtJS4.0 MVC examples available on Sencha's website. 

It also demonstrates Component Queries and some other new features in 2.0 such as automatic "getter" generation. 

This is based on the Sencha Touch 2.0 Developer Preview (may break) as of Oct 11, 2011
